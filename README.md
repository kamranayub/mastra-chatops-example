# Mastra Example ChatOps (WIP)

An example of building a Slack-based ChatOps agent with Mastra:

- Has working memory
- Hooked up to Slack
- Can restart virtual machines with Vultr tool
- Showcases Human-in-the-Loop approvals with Slack BlockKit UI

## Video

I explain the architecture and what I've done so far here:

## To Run It

1. You'll need some [Slack API keys and an app all hooked up properly](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/getting-started/)
2. You'll need a [Vultr](https://vultr.com) account and API key
3. You'll need [OpenAI developer keys](https://platform.openai.com)

Then:

```sh
bun install # or npm install
bun start # start Slack Bolt server
bun run dev # starts Mastra dev studio
```

> [!NOTE]
> The demo files are what I'm using in real-life, so it's not really meant to be run but you certainly can try ðŸ˜„ There's nothing product-specific here (yet).

The way the app is written here is not meant to be hosted outside the local machine. I'm working on a Slack Bolt receiver that integrates with Mastra's Hono server using custom API endpoints. Once I have that figured out, it should be able to be hosted on Mastra Cloud or another provider for production use.
